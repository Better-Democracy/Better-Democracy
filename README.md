## What We Believe
The following repository is a collection of ideas for a better democratic system.

We believe that a democratic system is the best system to address our needs as a species. But [current systems](https://github.com/Jiwe-Mobarez/Better-Democracy/blob/main/Systems/Current-Models/README.md) still have a lot of room to improve. Our political systems should enhance the quality of our political movements, not slow down our progress. Our represantatives should be the most trustable, capable and accepted members of our societies, not be the kinds that look barely look different to crime syndicates. Current systems lack the proper guidelindes to encourage social growth while shaping the modern roles and powers of politicians. As a result, these systems have become the playing fields of the most morally reprehensible to exploit public trust in pursuit of personal greed and egoism.

We believe that the likeliest cause of the inefficiencies of modern political systems is due to their age, and inability to adapt to newer techonologies. Some of the important elements of their designs no longer stand the test of time. They fail to allocate enough resources to satisfy modern digital citizens' needs. They are a product of a time in which humans were very limited to their immediate geography. They fail to satisfy the modern humans' expectations of a working government simply because they were never meant to address the issues they have to address now.

With the advent of cheaper transportation, regional differences in people should be a much lower priority than the efficiency of the system as a whole. Federated decision-making institutions are an inefficient factor when you can take an airplane and move to a different state within 40 minutes. On top of this, limited-member congresses are a product of a time in which people didn't have enough education or daily time to decide and vote directly on their own matters. Unspecialized legislation branches are a product of a time in which a single represantative was actually capable of learning about the intricate details of many fields. Nowadays, systems are so complex and actual experts are so numberable that we need better ways of

With the advent of the internet and modern statistical digital tools, we have a better understanding of the areas that need to be changed to reflect the change in the population's education level. By developing [better models](https://github.com/Jiwe-Mobarez/Better-Democracy/blob/main/Systems/README.md) for democratic systems using modern tools and science, for modern humans and their modern needs; we can make a better, more just world that old systems cannot efficiently address. Our current systems were designed ages ago when we had no cars, no internet, and no social media; and much more. We no longer use horses for transportation, printing presses for printing, or the telegraph for communication; so why shouldn't we improve on the political systems of those times?

## What Are Our Aims

We aim to propose new political systems to represent the progress of thought as well as the advancement of technology.

We suggest ideas and plans to expand our understanding of democracy. To innovate in the most important field that decides the fate of individuals and nations. Using new technologies, computer science principles, and academic research, we aim to propose better democratic systems.

## Our Focus: Iran’s Ongoing Revolution

Most of our original team members are originnaly Iranian. The current situation in Iran requires us to act quickly, and intelligently. Developing the best democratic systems to be established in the future is vital. Our design choices will mostly be focused on the regional needs of Iran. However, most essays will still be suitable for other nationals that care about democracy and a better future.

Our regional Iranian strategy is to implement a true working democracy in the next government. We want to ensure these systems will be able to handle all the workload of a government still in its infancy. Especially considering all the threats looming around. The system to come needs to be professionally designed and tested if we want to gain the trust of Iranian intellectuals and ordinary people. To achieve this, our efforts will be mainly in these two areas:

1. Advertise the adoption of democracy as the preferred mode of governance. Essays, articles, and media need to be produced or translated for the public to consume. Digital Advocacy Groups will need to be established to carry out these tasks. Organizations and charities will also be needed to help accelerate the adoption of democracy and democratic principles in Iran.

2. Design appropriate democratic systems. Inherent issues of the current democratic systems need to be identified, and solutions need to be designed to reflect our global progress in the field of political and social, and human sciences. The solutions need to be properly designed by experts, developed using cutting-edge technologies, properly tested, and constantly updated to reflect real-world needs.

## This repository

This repository will contain most of our new democratic system designs. Many competing systems and architectures may be worked on at the same time. Complementary information for each section may be found at our [GitHub](https://github.com/irandigitaldemocracy), [Discord](https://discord.gg/2zkS4MekxB), or multiple like-minded [websites](https://github.com/Jiwe-Mobarez/Awesome-Iran-Resistance).

Our efforts in this repository may include a few main categories:

1. Content Regarding The Traditional democratic Systems + Their Strengths and Flaws
2. Proposed Real World Systems and Implementations
3. Manifestos and Member Suggestions
4. Explanation of Goals and Principles
5. Short Term and Long Term Guidelines and Strategies

In addition to the traditional ideas of equality, freedom, and wellfare, we believe in some other [principles](https://github.com/Jiwe-Mobarez/Better-Democracy/blob/main/Principles/README.md) as well.

We are also working on two separate political solutions aimed to fix different issues of the current democratic systems. All of our projects can be tightly integrated with each-other or be components in other political systems.

### Specialized Congresses Model:

Why vote for politicians that represent millions of people on multitudes of completly different issues, when experts are more educated in their individual fields? We aim to replace tradition congresses that resolve issues in all fields, with smaller congresses limited to specialized departments.

Instead of only a few politicians being legally allowed to suggest and vote on final policies, all experts will be allowed to participate in both policy suggestion and voting processes. Since this system is still a democracy, many critisism and flaws of democracy are still significant factors to consider. Many design decisions have been made to address and reduce these critisisms (e.g. gridlocks, political polarizations, inefficiencies, conflicts of interest, etc.)

We have used our knowledge in computer science to optimize the system and provide solutions for issues. However, many elements of the system are yet to be tested in the real world. We really appreciate a fresh perspective.

You can read more about this system [here](https://github.com/Jiwe-Mobarez/Better-Democracy/blob/main/Systems/Expert-Driven/README.md)

### Deliberative Democracy Model:

Inspired by the e-democracy movements in Taiwan, we are also working on a deliberative democratic system.

This project is aimed to improve public-government relations, embrace digital tools, improve efficiency, and utilise real-time systems for gathering, analyzing and understanding what large groups of people want.

Our Deliberative sysems are tasked to establish and encourage dialogue among diverse stakeholders, citizens and decision-makers. After agreements and shared truths, facts, and experiences are established, our systems works to efficiently implement suggestions and policies that all parties had a part in designing.

## Introduction to Iran Digital Democracy

<img src="https://github.com/Jiwe-Mobarez/Better-Democracy/blob/main/Assets/Images/General/fist.png?raw=true">

A sister project of our team is the [Iranian Digital Democracy](https://github.com/irandigitaldemocracy) movement. IDD aims to create digital tools and solutions for our real-world problems. The IDD movement has its own goals, principles, and challenges.
Some IDD goals and principles are:

- Digital [Transparency](https://github.com/irandigitaldemocracy/digital-transparency) in Government Financial Matters:
- Digital Transparency in Governmental Decision Making Process (e.g. in areas such as education, healthcare, city management, etc)
- Digital Transparency for Government Plans and Goals
- Protecting the Privacy and the Rights of all Citizens Digitally
- Using New Digital Technologies for all [Governmental](https://github.com/irandigitaldemocracy/digital-democracy) Services
- Utilising Direct [Voting](https://github.com/irandigitaldemocracy/voting-platform) Platforms for all Decisions

This repository and the Better Democracy Movement is an attempt of the IDD group at producing and gathering essays in favor of a push for change in mainstream political discourse by addressing the very own nature of political institutions as an important factor of political landscapes.

IDD is designed to act as the local Iranian organization tasked to implement Better Democracy ideas. Better political systems are a universal need of all humans, but due to each nation having its own unique requirements, local, national, and regional institutions will still be needed to implement these ideas in each region separately.

## Furthur Collaboration

All International contributions to this repo are welcome. You can submit your ideas via push requests. Our editorial guidelines can be found [here]()

Also, our institutional belief is that democratic efforts need to be gathered in a central hub to encourage more productivity and division of concerns. Contributions to Iran Digitial Democracy tools, Better Democracy Movement theoric media, or joining our NewIran communities are highly appreciated.

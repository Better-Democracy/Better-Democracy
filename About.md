## Who Are We?

IDD is a collection of people who wanna do something brand new. In a traditional system so far from modern practices, they want to be a new light with which new horizons will be seen. They are good people. I am happy to be among them. You can join us too if you want.

## Who Is Jiwe?

I have always dreamed of a world in which people are more united, more thoughtful, and more considerate of each other. Earth without wars, misallocation of resources, or regional inequalities. A world that is built on the principles of human dignity, egalitarianism, progress, and science. Oh boy, wouldn't it be so nice?

I believe that this dream will not become a reality without action, activism, planning, careful engineering, and data collection. However, so long as human greed and inefficient political systems take hostage the global populationâ€™s desire for a similar better world, this dream wonâ€™t come to any fruition. So the first step towards such a future is to develop political systems that can get us closer to our human utopias, and away from global poverty, food insecurity, and corruption. I plan to describe political systems that are more efficient, encourage unity instead of hostility, and are designed by academics and scientists rather than politicians.

I am no writer. I am no storyteller. I believe ideas need to have merit and be applicable in the real world. I take no pleasure in writing about my dreams that will never come true. I prefer actionable, realistic missions and initiatives that have a quantifiable positive effect on our world and the future. I also believe that merely doing something positive may not be enough. I believe in maximizing my personal positive effect on the world and designing systems that optimize output depending on what the most important factors are.

And as such, I believe I have to start writing down what future I want to live in. Surely, most of these ideas have already been studied in academia extensively. Iâ€™d like to talk about them regardless. I want to bring these subjects to light, making them mainstream. So that hopefully, the general public will someday push for some change.

I know that my ideas will probably be too hard to implement or simply ridiculous. The best ones will still sound incomplete and unfinished. I will probably not be taken seriously in some areas. But it's ok! I feel like I'm doing this both for myself, as well as the world. This is my [ikigai](https://ikigai-living.com/what-is-ikigai/). I feel I might have something to contribute to the global push toward progress. Even locally, with Iran getting closer and closer to revolution, I'd like to be able to contribute something and suggest new systems.

I have to be fast. If I am not, I fear the potential consequences. So I'll be writing about many things and I'd probably sacrifice depth in pursuit of breadth. It's so painful for me because I have a perfectionistic desire to explain everything extensively. But it's ok. So if you find any problems with what I wrote down, please send them to me. It's most likely that I totally forgot to mention anything about these points. If you find any subject you disagree with me on, it's fine! Totally! I'm happy someone is taking what I'm writing down seriously. You can send your alternative beliefs and systems to me and I'll add them to the articles ðŸ˜„ . I believe in the principle of [Modularity]() so everything should probably work ok with your idea as well ðŸ˜Š
